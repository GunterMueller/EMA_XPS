Section I: Using Allegro CL 4.1 inspite of CLISP:
==========

You might be unnecessarily rich and wish to use the Allegro CL 4.1 
CommonLISP interpreter inspite of the public domain product CLISP:

1) Take a running Allegro CL 4.1 image (e.g. 'cl41') from a dark, deep corner
   of your hard disc, and create the Babylon-2.3 image according to the
   Babylon-2.3/README. Next edit
      src/bablisp
   to make it run: place the absolute
   path to this image (verify that it runs :)

2) Since Allegro does not have a lisp.run starter, change the commentations
   in the appropriate lines of
      bin/Makefile
   comment out the CLISP command line, and uncomment the Allegro line (note:
   the lines are fine, only modify the comments :)

3) edit src/emalisp and src/remalisp analogous...

4) run (make) now... that should be all


Section II: Gcc is unavailable, the X11 includes or libs are mislocated:
===========

Since I did not have the time to set up GNU configure, I worked around
using the batches (sorry: shell scripts for users of real operating systems)

   util/cc_X11: where are the X11 and Xm includes located?

   util/ld_X11: where are the X11 and Xm *.a/*.so libs located?
                (note: this may differ, when Motif 1.2/2.0 is available on your site!)
                Furthermore different libs might be needed, if building binary
                distributions using static bindings (preferably done when your
                OS is *not* shipped with Motif included e.g. Linux, SunOS, FreeBSD)

                I've been testing Linux 1.2 (AOUT) *and* Linux 2.0 (ELF) with
                Metrolink Motif 2.0, SunOS with Motif 2.0, the remaining OSes
                under test have had Motif 1.2.4.

Those scripts might fail, if you are using environments not already tested
by me :(     ### THIS NEED NOT BE ERRONEOUS! ###

In cases mentioned in the headline, feel free to modify those two skripts
to fit your needs. 

In later releases I might succeed in offering some kind of util/configure
which does those simple checkings.


Section III: OSes with different initialization of PTY/TTY pairs:
============

You might want to have a look at my notes on porting to IRIX in Porting.log
IRIX sets up /dev/ttyqNNN and /dev/pts/NNN pairs with NNN=[0;120]

In such cases looking into src/color-xterm-x11r6_main.c, which is the main.c
of the X11R6 version of xterm, may help.

In cases where your OS does not inherit the ioctl() settings from the
calling xterm/(shell), will might adopt the HP-UX (hpux) solution.
