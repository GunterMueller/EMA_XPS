Note:

  This copyright does *not* cover the following software products,
  EMA-XPS requires to work:
  1) The AI Workbench Babylon version 2.3 which is told to offer
     copyright conventions similar to those of the X Window System
     (ftp://ftp.gmd.de/GMD/ai-research/Software/Babylon/...)
  2) A LISP Interpreter; preferrably CLISP, which is also covered by
     the terms of the GNU-GPL
     (ftp://ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de/pub/lisp/clisp/...) 
  3) The OSF/Motif Widget Library, which underlies the copyright
     and licencing modalities of the Open Software Foundation
     (or - as soon as it works - the GNU copyrighted Lesstif library
     ftp://pain.csrv.uidaho.edu/pub/hungry/lesstif/...)
  and of course a C compiler like GNU's gcc, a UNIX(TM)-like operating
  system like Linux and the X Window System.
