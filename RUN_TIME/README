          EMA-XPS v2 - A Hybrid Graphic Expert System Shell
          =================================================

     EMA-XPS is a hybrid graphic expert system shell based on the
     ASCII-oriented  shell  Babylon  2.3  of  the German National
     Research Center for Computer Sciences (GMD). In addition  to
     Babylon's  AI-power  (object  oriented  data representation,
     forward and backward chained rules - collectable into  sets,
     horn  clauses,  and constraint networks) a graphic interface
     based on the X11 Window  System  and  the  OSF/Motif  Widget
     Library has been provided.

     To avoid collisions of the two programming techniques (event
     oriented  vs. procedural style), two separate programs solve
     these  different  jobs.  The   first   one    works    event
     oriented.  It  initializes a bidirectional pair of interpro-
     cess communication channels using one pseudo teletype  (like
     xterm).   In   advance   it spawns  a  LISP-world containing
     the features of Babylon and the extensions for  interprocess
     communication.

     In addition to the AI-features of Babylon it offers a  task-
     processor.  For  the  input of knowledge specialized editors
     have been realized.  Additional  support  is  granted  by  a
     tracer.  At  session time a flexible and widely configurable
     full-screen application and popup dialogs are available. The
     user  may choose to ask for explanations on the state of the
     inference process. For information on how to use EMA-XPS  at
     run-time,   an   interactive   help  facility  is  provided.
     Meanwhile the on-line documentation of the Babylon syntax is
     offered this way, too.

     Beginning with version 2.1 of EMA-XPS knowledge  base  files
     of the shell ``babylon 3.1-beta'' from VW-GEDAS (which is no
     more available) can be loaded, too. Those KBs are translated
     into EMA-XPS style KBs at load-time (see the release notes).

     Additionally to the source distribution
       http://wmwap1.math.uni-wuppertal.de/EMA-XPS/FTP/emaxps.tar.gz
     currently static bound versions for Linux 1.2 (AOUT)
       http://wmwap1.math.uni-wuppertal.de/EMA-XPS/FTP/LinuxAOUT.tar.gz
     and SunOS 4.1 are available
       http://wmwap1.math.uni-wuppertal.de/EMA-XPS/FTP/SunOS.tar.gz
     Both are  linked with X11R6 and OSF/Motif 2.0  libraries and
     use Bruno Haible's CLISP interpreter.
