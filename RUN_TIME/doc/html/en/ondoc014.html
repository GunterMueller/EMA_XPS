<PRE>The Rule-Editor
===============

Rules can be edited with the rule editor. To select
the respective knowledge base you have to click on
the field with the label &quot;Knowledge Base&quot;. To select
the rule set and the rule you have to click on the
corresponding fields. If a new rule or rule set has
to be provided, then the new name has to be entered
in the field selection of the selection menue.

The Edit menu:

- Apply this Rule...
      The modified rule will be transfered into
      the knowledge base.
- Delete this Rule...
      The rule will be removed from the knowledge
      base.
- Delete this Rule Set...
      The rule set and its rules will be removed
      from the knowledge base.
- Undo Changes
      The old rule definition is reloaded from
      the knowledge base. This option is unavailable
      for a newly created rule.
- Move this Rule...
      This way the execution order of the rules
      within a set can be changed.
      A further selection menue appears, to select
      a rule in whose neighbourhood the current rule
      should be moved. A further choise is on whether
      to move the current rule in front or behind
      the selected rule.

Rule modifications, not yet updated in the KB,
are displayed by an exclamation mark in the top right
corner.

The Babylon2 junctor and action types can be changed
by clicking on the fields &quot;IF&quot; or &quot;THEN&quot;. This will
offer a selection popup dialog.

Help on the syntax of babylon- and lisp-expressions 
can be requested by placing the text cursor into a
word in the text fields of the editors, followed by
a keypress on the [Help]-Button [F1].
