       Loads a new KB from a EMA-XPS or babylon3 stylus
       file and makes it current. babylon3 KBs are
       translated into EMA-XPS style during loading.
       WARNING: Babylon2 KB files can NOT be read cor-
                rectly!

       Displays all knowledge bases, currently known
       to the inference engine. the current KB is mar-
       ked by a '&gt;' sign.
       When a knowledge base has been changed, a sharp
       sign &quot;#&quot; behind the name of that KB in the
       [File] menu displays differences between the
       version stored in the file and the version of
       the KB within the LISP world.
       When the string &quot;!!&quot; is displayed, Changes
       within the knowledge editors are marked, which
       differ from the contents of the LISP world.
       Those changes do not take effect to session runs
       or rewriting to KB files, yet!
