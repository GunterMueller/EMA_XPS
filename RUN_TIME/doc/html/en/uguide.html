<dd>
I would like to order my acknowledgements chrono-
logically:
<dd>

At first I want to thank my Professor Joachim Holtz
for supporting this idea for the comlete time of
this project and granting availability of latest
computing power (ApolloDomainOS, SunOS, Linux).
<dd>

Remembering the first steps in X11/Motif&#174; pro-
gramming and setting up UNIX&#174; Interprocess-
Communications I want to thank Andreas Hennecke
for the parts of source he added to build the X-
version of EMA-Laboratory's Graphics Standard GRF3.
This was used to build the KLED-application, an
interactive tool for mouse-oriented manipulation
of graphs, which is part of the EMA-XPS distri-
bution. In this context the concept of a two-
process-solution (one event-oriented, the other
with a sequential work-flow) was born. The infe-
rence engine of Babylon2 (developed by the GMD)
works merely text-oriented, but its source is
available free of charge. To avoid &quot;re-inventing
the wheel&quot; only the graphic support should be 
added by accompanying the Babylon2-process with
a graphics manager.
<dd>

For testing and implementing a first version of
this solution adapted to the demands of this pro-
ject, the core-part of EMA-XPS v1, Jochen Krom-
berg must be honored.
<dd>

In advance the work of Klaus Senf must be grate-
fully mentioned. He built the complete rest of
the GUI of EMA-XPS v1 to demonstrate the great
chances of this concept.
<dd>

Although it were bad news, that &quot;babylon v3.1-
beta&quot; from VW-GEDAS was removed from the market,
the hopes in this project were strongly growing.
The idea of adapting EMA-XPS to become a repla-
cement for babylon3 emerged higher stability and
flexibility of the core-IPC.
Therefore the number of physical channels has
been reduced to 1. Up to 1000 virtual channels
can be multiplexed across it now.
<dd>

The most important prerequisite for the replace-
ment-task was building a babylon3-like graphic
session-time user-interface. This has been cre-
ated by Michael Block with great love in details.
<dd>

For studying the knowledge-programming-languages
of Babylon2 and babylon3, their common sets and
their differences, I'd like to thank Jan Legen-
hausen. He found the principles of how-to-trans-
form babylon3 constructs into Babylon2/EMA-XPS
ones. Therefore he developed the language-trans-
lator &quot;3to2&quot;, which has been superseded by a 
load-time input-filter as a part of EMA-XPS v2.1.
<dd>

For converting and optimizing the knowledge-
editors of EMA-XPS v1 my thanks aren't finally 
directed to Karsten Vossberg and Stephan Peters.
This includes changing code in a way, that the
complete multi-language-support of EMA-XPS v2.1
has been moved to X-Resources. This enables
even users of binary distributions to build 
their own language support.
<dd>

Last but not least to mention is Frans Ceelen,
who added online documentation of the state of the
babylon3 emulation. This help on syntax is available 
while editing knowledge from within the text fields
of the knowledge editors.
<p>
