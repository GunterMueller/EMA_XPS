<PRE>The Restriction-Editor
======================

Restrictions can be edited and provided with the
restriction editor.
To select the respective knowledge base you have
to click on the field with the label &quot;Knowledge Base&quot;.
The field below makes it possible to select a 
restriction. If a new restriction has to be provided,
then the new name has to be entered in the field
selection of the restriction selection menue.

The Edit menu:

- Apply this Restriction...
       The changed restriction will be transfered into
       the knowledge base. 
- Delete this Restriction...
       This restriction will be removed from the
       knowledge base.
- Undo Changes
       The old restriction definition is reloaded
       from the knowledge base.
- Relink this Restriction
       This restriction will be linked again to
       the related constraints and constraint nets 
       corresponding to the definitions, which were 
       made in the editor.
- Relink all Restrictions
       All restrictions, which were defined in this
       knowledge base will be linked to the related
       constraints and constraint nets.

Restriction modifications, not yet updated in the KB,
are displayed by an exclamation mark in the top right
corner.

Help on the syntax of babylon- and lisp-expressions 
can be requested by placing the text cursor into a
word in the text fields of the editors, followed by
a keypress on the [Help]-Button [F1].
