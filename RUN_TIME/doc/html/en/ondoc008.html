<PRE>The Explanation Window
======================

Warning: The babylon3 explanation facility is not
         emulated! In fact this is an interactive
         graphic front end to the Babylon2
         inference engine!

To interactively start the EMA-XPS explanation
facility, two menus and their entries are avail-
able. This way public LISP functions may be acti-
vated, which may be programmed into the KB, too.

- EXPLANATION
  -CLEAR
       Erases the contents of the explanation
       window.
  -INSPECT
       Displays a term selected from a ruleset.
  -HOW?
       Selection of a true fact and explanation on
       from which rules this fact has been used.
  -HOW-ALL?
       Selection of any fact and explanation on
       from which rules this fact has been used. 
  -WHY-NOT?
       Selection of an unprovable fact and corres-
       ponding explanation.
  -PROLOG-WHY?
       Shows and gives reasons for the recent state
       of the proof process (The evaluation of the
       prolog clauses).
