<PRE>FORMAT
======

syntax: (format &lt;stream&gt; &lt;format-string&gt; {&lt;arg&gt; ...})

This function is used to produce a formatted output.
The format directives consist of a tilde (~), 
optional prefix parameters separated by commas, 
optional colon (:) and at-sign (@) modifiers, 
and a single character indicating what kind of 
directive this is.

~A     Ascii. An &lt;arg&gt;, any Lisp object, is printed 
               without escape characters. The output 
               is not suitable for input to read.
~S     Symbolic-expression. This is just like ~A, 
               but &lt;arg&gt; is printed with escape 
               characters. The output is therefore 
               suitable for input to read.
~D     Decimal. An &lt;arg&gt;, which should be an integer, 
               is printed in decimal radix.
~B     Binary. This is just like ~D but prints in 
               binary radix instead of decimal.
~O     Octal. This is just like ~D but prints in 
               octal radix instead of decimal.
~X     Hexadecimal. This is just like ~D but prints 
               in hexadecimal radix instead of 
               decimal.
~F     Fixed-format floating-point. The next &lt;arg&gt; 
               is printed as a floating point number. 
               The full form is ~w,d,kF. The 
               parameter w is the width of the field 
               to be printed. d is the number of 
               digits to print after the decimal 
               point. k is a scale factor that 
               defaults to zero.
~E     Exponential floating-point. The next &lt;arg&gt; is 
               printed as a floating point number in 
               exponential notation. The full form is
               ~w,d,e,kE. e is the number of digits 
               to use when printing the exponent.
~$     Dollars floating-point. The next argument is 
               printed as a floating-point number in 
               fixed-format notation. This format is
               particularly convenient for printing 
               a value as dollars and cents. The full 
               form is ~d,n,w$. n is the minimum 
               number of digits to print before the
               decimal point (default value 1)
~%     This outputs a #\newline character, thereby 
               terminating the current output line 
               and beginning a new one.
~|     This outputs a page separator character, if 
               possible.
~T     Tabulate. This spaces over to a given column. 
               ~colnum,colincT will output sufficient 
               spaces to move the cursor to column
               'colnum'.
~~     This outputs a tilde.
~&lt;nl&gt;  Tilde immediately followed by a newline 
               ignores the newline and any following 
               non-newline whitespace characters.
