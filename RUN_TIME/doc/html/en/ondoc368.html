<PRE>Unsupported
===========

EMA-XPS does not support the babylon3 explanation
facility and the knowledge editor programming inter-
face. All the same the corresponding function proto-
types are available as dummies. If evaluated, a hint
is given in the debugger. Execution of the KB is not
affected.


EXPLANATION FACILITY
--------------------

babylon3 offers functions for creating individual
explanation facilities per KB. 
They may be separated into defining functions,
administrative functions, application functions,
and flow controlling functions.

DEFINING FUNCTIONS
These functions allow creation of new types and
operators in the explanation facility.

ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS
These functions may be splitted into inspecting,
modifying and adapting functions. They have
administrative character.

APPLICATION FUNCTIONS
These are functions for displaying explanations.

FLOW CONTROLLING FUNCTIONS
These functions control the flow of the process.


PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
---------------------

The programming interface has to grant the practi-
cability of system modifications.
babylon3 offers interrogating functions, functions,
which change the structure of the knowledge base,
and functions for modifying the knowledge base.
