<PRE>Babylon Query Language (BQL)
============================

The following pages concentrate on a babylon3
extension to GMD's hybrid shell Babylon2, the
Babylon Query Language (BQL). It is intended to
offer access to facts via queries in a way
database applications use.

EMA-XPS offers a complete emulation of the BQL.
See the introducing pages on KNOWLEDGE-HANDLING
and SETs.

The organisation of this capter is close to
chapter 2 of the babylon3 documentation.   



The rest of this page introduces the notation
of the BQL:


BQL-EXPRESSION
==============

Syntax: &lt;bql-expression&gt; ::=
               {&lt;ask-expression&gt; | 
                &lt;tell-expression&gt; |
                &lt;untell-expression&gt; |
                &lt;retell-expression&gt;}

ASK, TELL, UNTELL and RETELL are bql-expressions, with 
which you can question or change the knowledge base.



SIMPLE-PREDICATION
==================

Syntax: [&lt;framename&gt; {instance | &lt;bql-variable&gt;]
        [&lt;relation-name&gt; {instance | &lt;bql-variable&gt;}
            {value | &lt;bql-variable&gt;}]

A simple predication can be a one-argument-predication
or a two-argument-predication. A one-argument predica-
tion describes a frame-instance relation. A two-argu-
ment predication describes an instance-value relation.
It is insignificant, if a part- or a characteristic-
relation between the instance and the values exists.
The two-argument-predication is used in connection
with TELL, UNTELL and RETELL. In connection with
ASK, the predication can be a one-argument- or
a two-argument-predication.

The expressions in the predication will be worked
out from the left to the right, but should be regarded
as quasi-parallel.



COMPOUND-PREDICATION
====================

Compound-predications are predications that
are bound with AND, OR or NOT ([and... ; 
[or... ; [not...).
they may only be used in bql-expressions or
with rules. Warning: do not use '(and...' for
mistake.



BQL-VARIABLE
============

Syntax: &lt;bql-variable&gt; ::= &lt;lisp-type: symbol&gt;

A bql-variable is a variable with an under-
line, that can be used in every bql-expression.
It will sequentially be bound to the values
which are found in the knowledge base.

Example: &gt;(ask [computer _x]
            (kb-format &quot;~% the base of 
            knowledge contains the following
            computer: ~% ~A&quot; (name-of _x)))
         the base of knowledge contains the
                  following computer:
         SIEMENS-NIXDORF
         the base of knowledge contains the
                  following computer:
         WANG
         NIL



BABYLON-VARIABLE
================

Syntax: &lt;babylon-variable&gt;

A babylon-variable is a variable without an
underline and is used as a placeholder.

Example: &gt;(define-behavior equipment
           :primary ((a-computer computer)
                     (an-option options))
           :documentation &quot; &quot;
           :explanation nil
           (kb-confirm &quot;Would you like to
             have ~: (~A~) in your computer?&quot;
             (name-of an-option)))
         =&gt;        
         #&lt;Behavior-Method EQUIPMENT
                          (COMPUTER OPTIONS)&gt;

In this example a-computer and an-option are
babylon variables.



LISP-TYPE
=========

Syntax: &lt;lisp-type: T&gt;

This can be any lisp-expression or babylon-
expression, that has the same behaviour like
a lisp-expression and returns a defined value.
A lisp-expression can be: a number, a string,
a symbol, a list or a functioncall.



CONTINUATION
============

Syntax: &lt;bql-continuation&gt; ::= 
             {&lt;lisp-type::=T&gt; ...}

The continuation can only be used together
with the ASK-expression similarly the THEN-part
of a rule. It consists of babylon-expressions,
which may contain logical variables sofar these
are used in the corresponding predication.
The continuation will be repeated until no
further bindings of logical variables may be
achieved.



BQL-ANONYMUS
============

Syntax: &lt;bql-anonymus&gt; ::= _

The anonymus variable is only characterized by
an underline and can be used together with
the functions RETELL and UNTELL. This variable
can be used instead of a value. It can 
represent a quantity of values too. The
anonymus variable has no content.

Example: &gt;(untell [options computer _])
         T
brings the relation options for the
instance computer in the condition &quot;indefinite&quot;.
